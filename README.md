Tracks bus between MIT and Harvard
This bus tracker gets data from a map API and uses it to track the current location of the bus that goes between MIT and Harvard.

**How to Run**

Open up the application and view the blue map marker that will show you where the bus is currently.

**Roadmap of future improvements**

In the future we could add more busses to track between many college campuses. 
We could also track other data such as bus fare and gas prices to help people know the best way to get around.

**License information**

This work falls under the MIT license.
